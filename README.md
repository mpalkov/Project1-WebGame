# Tic-Tac-Toe

## My project idea
My idea is to make the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. 2 players putting X and O-s in the 3x3 grid. The first one to accomplish 3 in a row wins.

## Backlog
If I have time, I will apply some of these extras
- add restart game button
- add hover effect on empty cells
- add animations
- add score (X wins: # | O wins: #)
    - add New Game button
- add option for computer as second-player
- add sound effects
- add more difficulty levels
- make it more fun
